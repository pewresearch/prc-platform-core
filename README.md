# PRC Platform Core

This is the core of the PRC Platform. It provides share functionality for all other plugins in the platform. It is a required plugin for the platform to work. It also provides the complete data structure for the platform, from post report package, to post types, to taxonomies, to everything in between.

### WIP.md

If you see  WIP.md in a folder that means that functionality is not yet complete and not in active use. It's a work in progress.
