# Attachments Report

This plugin adds a new report to admin columns that displays a reporting interface of attachments. You can filter by caption, alt text, or title.
Access this by clicking on "View Attachments Report" in the admin column, or by adding `?attachments-report=true` to the end of a post URL.
