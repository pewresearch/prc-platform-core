## Gutenberg Customization

PRC Platform relies on the concept of "Gutenberg Ramp" to manually opt-in post types to the Block Editor.
This is a hold-over from VIP and may change in the future to be all post types by default. 

This class handles Gutenberg core level customizations and settings. This does not manage blocks or block library but rather the Gutenberg plugin itself. Mostly, this handles loading Gutenberg editors for specific post types and grouping admin menus together.
