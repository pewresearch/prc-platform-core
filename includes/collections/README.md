## Collections

Collections are both a post type and a taxonomy, a hybrid-object-type.

The post has an inspector panel that let's you set things like primary color, secondary color, and collection icon. You can also, using art direction set things like the story item image and seo/social images.

If a post is in a collection it should otherwise be excluded from the main pub listing query.
