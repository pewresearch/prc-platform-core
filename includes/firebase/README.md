# PRC Platform Core: Firebase Module `@prc/firebase`

This is a work in progress module that will allow modules and plugins in PRC Platform to interact with Firebase. 

Currently this class just handles building and registering the Firebase JS module, `@prc/firebase`. 
Eventually, this class will also handle writes and reads to Firebase databsaes, user authentication, and lastly push notifications via the Firebase Cloud Messaging service.
