# Block Area Modules

This system is comprimised of two parts, the `Block Area` and the `Block Module`. Block Modules go into Block Areas, Block Areas are placed in the theme. Additionally a `Block Area Context Provider` is available to provide context of the Story Item ID's inside a Block Area to the primary `core/query` block on page.
